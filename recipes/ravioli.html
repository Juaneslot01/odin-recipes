    <ol>
        <li>Make Pasta Dough</li>
        <ul>
            <li>There are several ways to make fresh pasta dough. The food processor method is the fastest. To do so: add the flour, eggs and olive oil to a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Process to form dough, about 15-20 seconds. Remove to your work surface and cover with an upturned bowl for 5 minutes- it will be much easier to knead in the next step.</li>
            <li>Knead dough for 1-2 minutes to form a ball (donâ€™t worry about technique here, the food processor does most of the kneading for you) cover again, and let rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour to relax the gluten.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Make Ravioli Filling</li>
        <ul>
            <li>While the pasta dough is resting: combine the drained ricotta, mascarpone, chopped basil leaves, Parmesan cheese and egg. Season with salt and pepper; mix well. Give it a taste (it should be highly seasoned). Cover and chill until ready to use. This step can be done 1-2 days in advance.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Roll Pasta Dough Into Sheets</li>
        <li>Assemble & Cut Ravioli</li>
    </ol>
